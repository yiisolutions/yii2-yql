## What is YQL?

The YQL Web Service enables applications to query, filter, and combine data from different sources across the Internet. YQL statements have a SQL-like syntax, familiar to any developer with database experience. The following YQL statement, for example, retrieves geo data for Sunnyvale, CA:

```sql
select * from geo.places where text="sunnyvale, ca"
```
